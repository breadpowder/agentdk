This document provides structure and implementation guidelines for contributing to the agentic project. Please follow these strictly to ensure modularity, testability, and smooth multi-agent collaboration.
For any python file, be sure to ALWAYS add typing annotations to each function or class. Be sure to include return types when necessary. Add descriptive docstrings to all python functions and classes as well. Please use pep257 convention. Update existing docstrings if need be.

#### **MANDATORY VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:**
- [ ] ✅ Check for `/tests` directory requirement. All tests  always go under their respective `/tests` folders test the folder structure mirror with `src`.
- [ ] ✅ Use pytest syntax (required), do NOT use the unittest module.
- [ ] ✅ All tests should have typing annotations as well. Be sure to create all necessary files and folders.
- [ ] ✅ If you are creating files inside of ./tests, be sure to make a init.py file if one does not exist.
- [ ] ✅ Mock all external dependencies

#### **PREVENTION STRATEGY:**
```
STEP 1: ALWAYS READ CURSOR RULES FIRST
├── Check .cursor/rules/*.mdc
├── Read ALL cursor rule files completely
└── Create checklist from rules

STEP 2: VERIFY STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS
├── Test directory structure
├── File naming conventions
└── Dependencies and imports

STEP 3: IMPLEMENT WITH VERIFICATION
├── Follow ALL cursor rules
├── Apply user guidelines
└── Double-check compliance
```

#### **CENTRALIZED PROMPT MANAGEMENT RULE:**

**UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE**: All AI agent prompts MUST be externalized and centralized to ensure maintainability, consistency, and separation of concerns.

**✅ CORE REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **Centralized Prompt Storage**: Create dedicated `prompts.py` files within each agent module/directory
2. **Function-Based Prompts**: Each prompt must be a typed function returning a string
3. **Import-Only Pattern**: Agents must import prompts, never define them inline
4. **Dynamic Registry**: Maintain a registry for runtime prompt access
5. **Template Support**: Enable parameterized prompts for flexibility

**✅ UNIVERSAL STRUCTURE PATTERN:**
```
{agent_module}/
├── prompts.py              # Centralized prompt definitions
├── {agent_name}.py         # Agent imports from prompts.py
├── config.json            # Configuration files
└── tests/
    └── test_prompts.py     # Dedicated prompt tests
```

**✅ PROMPT FILE IMPLEMENTATION:**
```python
# prompts.py - Universal Template
from typing import Dict, Any

def get_{agent_type}_prompt() -> str:
    """Get the system prompt for {agent_type} agent.
    
    Returns:
        Formatted system prompt string
    """
    return """
    You are a {agent_type} agent...
    [Detailed prompt content]
    """

# Registry for dynamic access
AGENT_PROMPTS: Dict[str, callable] = {
    "{agent_type}": get_{agent_type}_prompt,
    # Add all agent types here
}

def get_prompt(agent_type: str) -> str:
    """Get prompt by agent type.
    
    Args:
        agent_type: Type of agent (key in AGENT_PROMPTS)
        
    Returns:
        Formatted prompt string
        
    Raises:
        KeyError: If agent_type not found in registry
    """
    if agent_type not in AGENT_PROMPTS:
        raise KeyError(f"Unknown agent type: {agent_type}")
    return AGENT_PROMPTS[agent_type]()

def get_custom_prompt(template: str, **kwargs: Any) -> str:
    """Get customized prompt with template variables.
    
    Args:
        template: Base template string
        **kwargs: Template variables to substitute
        
    Returns:
        Formatted prompt with substituted variables
    """
    return template.format(**kwargs)
```

**✅ AGENT IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN:**
```python
# In agent files - MANDATORY import pattern
from .prompts import get_{agent_type}_prompt

class {AgentName}:
    def _get_default_prompt(self) -> str:
        """Get the default system prompt."""
        return get_{agent_type}_prompt()  # NEVER inline strings
```

**❌ PROHIBITED ANTI-PATTERNS:**
- ❌ Hardcoded prompt strings in agent classes
- ❌ Duplicate prompt definitions across files
- ❌ Inline prompt strings in prompt methods
- ❌ Prompts scattered across multiple modules
- ❌ Prompt logic mixed with business logic

**✅ TESTING REQUIREMENTS:**
```python
# tests/test_prompts.py - Universal test pattern
import pytest
from {module}.prompts import get_{agent_type}_prompt, AGENT_PROMPTS

def test_get_{agent_type}_prompt():
    """Test {agent_type} prompt function."""
    prompt = get_{agent_type}_prompt()
    assert isinstance(prompt, str)
    assert len(prompt) > 0
    assert "specific_requirement" in prompt.lower()

def test_agent_prompts_registry():
    """Test prompt registry completeness."""
    assert "{agent_type}" in AGENT_PROMPTS
    assert callable(AGENT_PROMPTS["{agent_type}"])
```

**✅ BENEFITS:**
- **Maintainability**: Update prompts without touching agent code
- **Consistency**: Single source of truth prevents prompt drift
- **Testability**: Isolated prompt testing and validation
- **Flexibility**: Template support for prompt variations
- **Scalability**: Easy addition of new agent types
- **Separation of Concerns**: Prompt content separate from agent logic

**✅ VALIDATION CHECKLIST:**
- [ ] All prompts externalized to `prompts.py`
- [ ] Agent classes import prompts (no inline strings)
- [ ] Prompt registry implemented and tested
- [ ] Template support available for customization
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all prompts
- [ ] Documentation updated with prompt examples

    # your test logic here

#### **ABSTRACTION INTEGRITY PRINCIPLE:**

**UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE**: A "client" class that uses a "provider" class must only interact through the provider's high-level, public API. It must not bypass the API to directly manipulate the provider's internal state or replicate its orchestration logic.

**MOTIVATION**: Learned from refactoring `MemoryAwareAgent`, where the agent initially tried to orchestrate the internal components of `MemoryManager`, creating a brittle, tightly-coupled design. Correcting this by using `MemoryManager`'s public API (`store_interaction`) created a robust, maintainable, and decoupled system.

**❌ BRITTLE ANTI-PATTERN (Client Knows Too Much):**
```python
# Client (e.g., MemoryAwareAgent)
class Client:
    def __init__(self):
        self.provider = Provider()

    def do_work(self, data):
        # ❌ WRONG: Client is replicating the provider's internal logic.
        # This is brittle. If Provider's logic changes, this code breaks.
        self.provider.component_a.process(data)
        self.provider.component_b.update(data)
        self.provider.state.is_dirty = True
```

**✅ ROBUST PATTERN (Client Trusts the Abstraction):**
```python
# Provider (e.g., MemoryManager)
class Provider:
    def high_level_api_method(self, data):
        """This is the single source of truth for this operation."""
        self.component_a.process(data)
        self.component_b.update(data)
        self.state.is_dirty = True

# Client (e.g., MemoryAwareAgent)
class Client:
    def __init__(self):
        self.provider = Provider()

    def do_work(self, data):
        # ✅ CORRECT: Client uses the high-level, abstract API.
        # It doesn't need to know how the provider works internally.
        self.provider.high_level_api_method(data)
```

**✅ CORE BENEFITS:**
- **Decoupling**: Client and provider can evolve independently.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to the provider's internal logic do not break its clients.
- **Robustness**: Reduces the risk of creating inconsistent states by centralizing logic in the provider.
- **Simplicity**: Client code is cleaner and focuses on its own responsibility, not the provider's.

**✅ VALIDATION CHECKLIST:**
- [ ] When using a service/manager class, are you only calling its public methods?
- [ ] Does your code avoid accessing sub-components of a service directly (e.g., `service.sub_component.do_thing()`)?
- [ ] Is the logic for a complex operation fully encapsulated within the provider class?

Rule: alway Test after code fix or refactor.
Once you fixed code, MUST go ahead and RUN TEST on it and ensure the issue is resloved, DO NOT leave the implementation WITHOUT testing it, you must to test and ensure it fixed.

Rule: Centralized Logging Setup (Python)
All loggers must be initialized using the centralized logger setup defined in core/logging.py. No individual modules or classes may define their own logger configs.

Rule: Reflection
If you made a mistake, add the lesson you learned from general practise (the lesson can be applied to other project). ADD as a cursor rule to ./cursor/rules/python.mdc so you won't make the same mistake again

# Package Management with `uv`
These rules define strict guidelines for managing Python dependencies in this project using the `uv` dependency manager.

**✅ Use `uv` exclusively**

- All Python dependencies **must be installed, synchronized, and locked** using `uv`.
- Never use `pip`, `pip-tools`, or `poetry` directly for dependency management.

**🔁 Managing Dependencies**

Always use these commands:

```bash
# Add or upgrade dependencies
uv add <package>

# Remove dependencies
uv remove <package>

# Reinstall all dependencies from lock file
uv sync
```

**🔁 Scripts**

```bash
# Run script with proper dependencies
uv run script.py
```

You can edit inline-metadata manually:

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.12"
# dependencies = [
#     "torch",
#     "torchvision",
#     "opencv-python",
#     "numpy",
#     "matplotlib",
#     "Pillow",
#     "timm",
# ]
# ///

print("some python code")
```

Or using uv cli:

```bash
# Add or upgrade script dependencies
uv add package-name --script script.py

# Remove script dependencies
uv remove package-name --script script.py

# Reinstall all script dependencies from lock file
uv sync --script script.py
```

You are an AI assistant specialized in Python development. Your approach emphasizes:

Clear project structure with separate directories for source code, tests, docs, and config.
Modular design with distinct files for models, services, controllers, and utilities.
Configuration management using python dotenv environment variables.
Comprehensive testing with pytest.
Detailed documentation using docstrings and README files.

Dependency management via https://github.com/astral-sh/uv and virtual environments.


AI-friendly coding practices:

You provide code snippets and explanations tailored to these principles, optimizing for clarity and AI-assisted development.

Follow the following rules:

For any python file, be sure to ALWAYS add typing annotations to each function or class. Be sure to include return types when necessary. Add descriptive docstrings to all python functions and classes as well. Please use pep257 convention. Update existing docstrings if need be.

When writing tests, make sure that you ONLY use pytest or pytest plugins, do NOT use the unittest module. All tests should have typing annotations as well. All tests should be in ./tests. Be sure to create all necessary files and folders. If you are creating files inside of ./tests or ./src/goob_ai, be sure to make a init.py file if one does not exist.


## Inheritance Over Implementation RULE - NO CODE DUPLICATION AND PARENT CLASS FIRST
Proper OOP inheritance patterns are always preferable to code duplication; start with inheritance design, not implementation-first approach. ALWAYS NOT DUPLICATED CODE for inheritance and complete the logic in parent class first.

## CRITICAL EXCEPTION HANDLING RULE - FAIL FAST PRINCIPLE

**NEVER silently swallow exceptions in critical initialization or dependency loading paths.**

**BAD PATTERN - Silent Exception Swallowing:**
```python
def _load_tools(self) -> None:
    try:
        # Critical dependency loading
        self.tools = load_external_tools()
    except Exception as e:
        # ❌ WRONG: Silent failure allows abnormal state
        logger.error(f"Failed to load tools: {e}")
        # Continues with self.tools = [] - ABNORMAL STATE!
```

**GOOD PATTERN - Fail Fast with Smart Differentiation:**
```python
def _load_tools(self) -> None:
    try:
        self.tools = load_external_tools()
    except Exception as e:
        # ✅ CORRECT: Log AND re-raise for abnormal flows
        logger.error(f"Failed to load tools: {e}")
        raise  # Let caller decide if this is acceptable

def __init__(self, config: Optional[Config] = None):
    # Smart validation: differentiate expected vs abnormal flows
    if config and config.requires_external_deps:
        # MCP config provided = tools are REQUIRED
        if not self.tools:
            raise AgentInitializationError(
                "MCP configuration provided but no tools loaded. "
                "Check database connectivity and MCP server configuration."
            )
    elif not config:
        # No config = tools optional, just warn
        logger.warning("No MCP configuration provided, running with 0 tools")
```

**Key Principle**: Distinguish between **expected optional behavior** vs **abnormal failure states**:
- **Expected**: No config provided → warning acceptable
- **Abnormal**: Config provided but dependency failed → error required

**This prevents agents from silently running in broken states that appear functional but lack critical capabilities.**

## BOILERPLATE ELIMINATION RULE - CENTRALIZE COMMON PATTERNS

**MOTIVATION:** Learned from SubAgentInterface refactoring where 75% of code was duplicated boilerplate across agent implementations.

**Before refactoring:**
- EDAAgent: 266 lines (75% boilerplate)
- New agents required 200+ lines of repetitive code
- Code duplication across __init__, _initialize, query methods

**After refactoring:**
- EDAAgent: 102 lines (15% boilerplate) - **62% reduction**
- New agents require only 60-100 lines - **70% reduction**
- Zero code duplication

### **Rule 1: Identify Common Patterns Before Writing Subclasses**

**❌ BAD - Implementation First:**
```python
class Agent1:
    def __init__(self, llm=None, prompt=None, config=None):
        # 20+ lines of common setup
        
    def query(self, prompt):
        # 30+ lines of common processing
        
    def _initialize(self):
        # 25+ lines of common initialization

class Agent2:
    def __init__(self, llm=None, prompt=None, config=None):
        # Same 20+ lines of setup - DUPLICATED!
```

**✅ GOOD - Abstract Base Class First:**
```python
class BaseAgent(ABC):
    def __init__(self, llm=None, prompt=None, **kwargs):
        # Common setup logic centralized
        self.llm = llm
        self.config = self._prepare_config(prompt, **kwargs)
        
    def query(self, prompt: str) -> str:
        # Common query processing
        return asyncio.run(self.query_async(prompt))
        
    @abstractmethod
    def _get_default_prompt(self) -> str:
        pass
        
    @abstractmethod 
    async def _create_agent(self) -> None:
        pass

class Agent1(BaseAgent):
    def _get_default_prompt(self) -> str:
        return "Agent1 specific prompt"
        
    async def _create_agent(self) -> None:
        # Only agent-specific logic
```

### **Rule 2: Use Abstract Methods to Enforce Domain-Specific Implementation**

**❌ BAD - Optional Override Pattern:**
```python
class BaseAgent:
    def get_prompt(self):
        return "Generic prompt"  # Weak default

class SpecificAgent(BaseAgent):
    # May or may not override - inconsistent behavior
```

**✅ GOOD - Abstract Method Pattern:**
```python
class BaseAgent(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def _get_default_prompt(self) -> str:
        """Each agent MUST define its domain-specific prompt."""
        pass
        
    @abstractmethod
    async def _create_domain_logic(self) -> None:
        """Each agent MUST implement its specific logic."""
        pass
```

### **Rule 3: Constructor Parameter Handling in Parent Class**

**❌ BAD - Repeated Parameter Processing:**
```python
class Agent1:
    def __init__(self, llm=None, prompt=None, config=None, **kwargs):
        config = config or {}
        if prompt:
            config['prompt'] = prompt
        if llm:
            config['llm'] = llm
        # Same pattern repeated in every subclass

class Agent2:
    def __init__(self, llm=None, prompt=None, config=None, **kwargs):
        # Exact same parameter handling - DUPLICATION!
```

**✅ GOOD - Centralized Parameter Handling:**
```python
class BaseHandler:
    def __init__(self, config=None, logger=None, timeout=None, **kwargs):
        # Process ALL common parameters once
        self.config = self._prepare_config(config, **kwargs)
        self.logger = logger or self._get_default_logger()
        self.timeout = timeout or self._get_default_timeout()

class SpecificHandler(BaseHandler):
    # No __init__ needed! Inherits all parameter handling
```

# ✅ Universal Pattern
```python
class BaseProcessor:
    def execute(self) -> Result:
        """Template method - same steps, different implementations."""
        self._validate_input()
        self._setup_resources()
        result = self._do_core_processing()  # Abstract
        self._cleanup_resources()
        return result
        
    @abstractmethod
    def _do_core_processing(self) -> Result:
        """Only step that varies by processor type."""
        pass
```

## KEY LESSONS LEARNED & ISSUE CATEGORIES

### 1. The Criticality of Mobile-First Responsive Design

*   **Observed Issues:** Mobile display problems such as header crowding, small touch targets, unreadable text, poor spacing, and awkward image scaling are common when mobile is not a primary design driver.
*   **Generalized Lesson:** Adopt a mobile-first design and development strategy. Addressing mobile constraints (screen size, touch interaction, performance) from the project's inception leads to more adaptable, accessible, and user-friendly applications across all devices. This proactively mitigates common mobile usability failures.
*   **Actionable Insights for Future Development:**
    *   Integrate responsive design principles into the earliest wireframing and prototyping stages.
    *   Prioritize mobile layouts in CSS, then scale up for larger screens (progressive enhancement).
    *   Rigorously test on various mobile emulators and real devices throughout the development lifecycle.
    *   Mandate minimum touch target sizes (e.g., 44-48px) for all interactive elements.

### 2. Importance of a Consistent Visual Hierarchy & Spacing System

*   **Observed Issues:** Inconsistent padding/margins, cramped elements, and text too close to container edges. This detracts from perceived quality and usability.
*   **Generalized Lesson:** A well-defined spacing system and clear visual hierarchy are fundamental to good UX. Consistency in spacing, typography, and layout guides the user and improves scannability.
*   **Actionable Insights for Future Development:**
    *   Establish or adopt a design system/style guide early, specifying spacing units, typographic scales, color palettes, and layout grids.
    *   Enforce these standards consistently through code reviews and automated linting where possible.

### 3. User-Centric Text Readability & Formatting

*   **Observed Issues:** Inappropriate text alignment (e.g., center-alignment for long-form mobile text), small font sizes requiring zoom, and awkward text wrapping or hyphenation.
*   **Generalized Lesson:** Prioritize text legibility and readability within the user's context. Content should be easy to consume on the intended devices.
*   **Actionable Insights for Future Development:**
    *   Default to left-alignment for body copy, especially on mobile.
    *   Ensure base font sizes are generous (e.g., 16px CSS pixels as a common starting point) and provide sufficient line height (e.g., 1.5-1.7).
    *   Test typography on a range of devices and screen resolutions.

### 4. Effective Use and Management of Imagery and Media

*   **Observed Issues:** Poorly chosen image aspect ratios, ineffective cropping, and lack of optimization leading to slow load times or visual degradation. Inconsistent branding due to incorrect asset usage.
*   **Generalized Lesson:** Images and media must be purposeful, optimized for their display context, and consistently managed.
*   **Actionable Insights for Future Development:**
    *   Define image aspect ratio guidelines for common UI components (hero images, cards, thumbnails).
    *   Implement responsive image techniques (e.g., `<picture>` element, `srcset` and `sizes` attributes, WebP format).
    *   Maintain an organized, version-controlled asset library and ensure correct assets are used.

### 5. Design of Interactive Elements with Accessibility in Mind

*   **Observed Issues:** Small, tightly packed links or buttons that are difficult to tap accurately, especially on mobile. Lack of clear visual feedback for interaction.
*   **Generalized Lesson:** Interactive elements must be easily identifiable, operable, and accessible. This includes adequate sizing, spacing, and clear visual cues.
*   **Actionable Insights for Future Development:**
    *   Adhere to WCAG guidelines for touch target sizes and spacing.
    *   Ensure sufficient visual distinction for interactive elements, including focus and hover states.
    *   Test interactions on actual touch devices and with assistive technologies.

### 6. Proactive Content Strategy & Asset Management

*   **Observed Issues:** Development delays or rework due to late or incorrectly formatted content/assets. Layouts designed without considering real content length or type.
*   **Generalized Lesson:** Content decisions and asset availability significantly impact design and development. A clear content strategy and readily available, correctly formatted assets streamline the process.
*   **Actionable Insights for Future Development:**
    *   Involve content strategists/creators early in the design process.
    *   Design with real or realistic placeholder content.
    *   Establish a clear workflow for content provision, review, and updates.

### 7. Robust Error Handling & Link Integrity

*   **Observed Issues:** Broken links leading to 404 errors, unhandled form submission errors, or confusing error messages.
*   **Generalized Lesson:** Graceful error handling and maintaining link integrity are crucial for user trust and a professional experience. Users should be guided, not stranded, when errors occur.
*   **Actionable Insights for Future Development:**
    *   Implement comprehensive client-side and server-side validation for forms.
    *   Provide clear, user-friendly error messages and suggest solutions.
    *   Regularly audit the site for broken links (internal and external).
    *   Design informative and helpful custom 404 pages.

### 8. The Power of Iterative Development & Continuous Feedback

*   **Observed Issues:** A large volume of feedback or change requests arising late in the development cycle, leading to significant rework.
*   **Generalized Lesson:** Web development is an iterative process. Regular, smaller feedback loops throughout the lifecycle are more effective and less costly than large feedback dumps at the end.
*   **Actionable Insights for Future Development:**
    *   Employ agile or iterative development methodologies.
    *   Schedule frequent (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly) demos and review sessions with stakeholders.
    *   Utilize prototyping and user testing early and often to validate designs and flows.

## CONCLUSION

By consciously applying these lessons, development teams can enhance product quality, reduce rework, improve user satisfaction, and build more robust and maintainable web applications. These insights should serve as a valuable reference for planning, designing, and executing future projects.
