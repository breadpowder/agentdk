et me present my improvement suggestions one by one:

  Suggestion 1: Add CLI Error Handling and Diagnostics Section

  Current Issue: The conversation showed we encountered a CLI error where the EDA agent required an LLM parameter but the CLI couldn't provide one. The current instructions don't guide Claude on how to handle or diagnose such CLI integration
  issues.

  Proposed Addition: Add a new section called "CLI Error Handling and Diagnostics" that provides:
  - Systematic approach to diagnosing CLI errors
  - Common CLI integration issues and solutions
  - LLM requirement handling patterns
  - Clear error message interpretation

  How this improves performance: Claude will be better equipped to quickly diagnose and fix CLI integration issues rather than getting stuck on confusing error messages.

  Would you like me to proceed with this improvement?

  Suggestion 2: Update Agent Architecture Section

  Current Issue: The Quick Start section still shows factory-based agent creation (create_agent('eda', config=config, llm=llm)) but our conversation implemented a new architecture with SubAgentWithMCP and SubAgentWithoutMCP classes.

  Proposed Change: Update the Agent Creation section to reflect the current architecture with:
  - SubAgentWithMCP usage patterns
  - SubAgentWithoutMCP usage patterns
  - Explicit LLM parameter requirements
  - Path resolution for MCP configs

  How this improves performance: Claude will provide accurate, up-to-date guidance that matches the actual codebase implementation.

  Should I implement this change?

  Suggestion 3: Enhance Path Resolution Documentation

  Current Issue: The instructions mention "Relative paths resolved relative to config file location" but don't explain the sophisticated path resolution strategy we implemented, which was central to fixing the MCP loading issues.

  Proposed Addition: Add detailed explanation of:
  - How _resolve_mcp_config_path() works
  - Relative vs absolute path handling
  - Agent file location-based resolution
  - Fallback strategies

  How this improves performance: Claude will better understand and maintain the path resolution logic that was critical to the MCP fixes.

  Do you approve of this enhancement?

  Suggestion 4: Add Post-Refactoring Testing Emphasis

  Current Issue: While the instructions mention running tests, they don't emphasize the critical importance of comprehensive testing after major architectural changes like the SubAgent refactoring we performed.

  Proposed Enhancement: Strengthen the Testing Rule section with:
  - Emphasis on testing after architectural changes
  - Specific test patterns for agent initialization
  - CLI integration testing requirements
  - Error condition testing

  How this improves performance: Claude will be more thorough about testing after making significant changes, preventing regressions.

  Would you like me to add this emphasis?

  Please let me know which of these suggestions you'd like me to implement, and I'll proceed with the detailed changes.
