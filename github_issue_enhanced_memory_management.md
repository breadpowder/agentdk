# [Feature] Memory: Enhanced Memory Management with Session and Episodic Memory

## Summary
- **One-sentence description**: Implement intelligent memory management with automatic session memory compaction and user-guided episodic memory for cross-session learning
- **Impact level**: High
- **Component affected**: Memory/Core

## Problem Statement
- **Current limitations**: 
  - No automatic memory management leads to context window overflow
  - No persistent memory across sessions for learning from user preferences, rules, mistakes, and decisions
  - Lack of intelligent memory compaction and organization
  - Memory is not seamlessly integrated with agent workflow
- **Use cases**: 
  - Long-running agent sessions that exceed context limits
  - Multi-session workflows where agents need to remember user preferences and learned lessons
  - Enterprise users requiring consistent agent behavior based on accumulated knowledge
- **Business value**: 
  - Improved agent performance through persistent learning
  - Better user experience with consistent behavior across sessions
  - Efficient resource utilization through intelligent memory management

## Proposed Solution
- **High-level approach**: Two-tier memory system with automatic session management and user-controlled episodic memory
- **User experience**: 
  - Transparent session memory compaction when approaching limits
  - Interactive prompts for episodic memory updates
  - Configurable memory limits and thresholds
- **Integration points**: Extends existing memory system with new compaction and cross-session capabilities

## Technical Requirements

### Session Memory Management
- **Automatic compaction**: Trigger when context window exceeds configurable threshold (default: 10k tokens)
- **Configuration**: User-configurable memory thresholds
- **Seamless operation**: Memory compaction should not interrupt agent workflow

### Episodic Memory System
- **Token limit**: Configurable limit for episodic memory (default: 100k tokens)
- **Trigger conditions**: Memory updates prompted for:
  - a. User preferences discovered/changed
  - b. Rules established or modified
  - c. Lessons learned from agent mistakes
  - d. User decisions made during sessions
- **User interaction**: Prompt user when episodic memory should be updated
- **Memory structure**: Design for easy updating and compaction

### Seamless Agent Integration
- **Memory must be integrated with agent seamlessly**: The memory system should be transparent to agent operation and not require explicit memory management calls
- **Automatic memory injection**: Relevant episodic memory automatically injected into agent context
- **Background processing**: Memory compaction and updates occur without disrupting agent workflow
- **Context-aware retrieval**: Memory retrieval based on current conversation context and relevance

### Memory Organization
- **Structured storage**: Memory organized by categories (preferences, rules, lessons, decisions)
- **Update mechanisms**: Easy addition, modification, and removal of memory entries
- **Compaction strategy**: Intelligent summarization when approaching token limits
- **User control**: User interface for reviewing and managing episodic memory

## Integration Analysis
- **Current approach**: Basic memory system without cross-session persistence
- **Alternative approaches**: 
  - Vector database for semantic memory storage
  - Hierarchical memory with different retention policies
  - Rule-based vs. LLM-guided memory compaction
- **Technology comparison**: 
  - File-based storage vs. database storage for episodic memory
  - Manual vs. automatic memory categorization
  - Real-time vs. batch memory processing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Session memory automatically compacts when exceeding configurable threshold
- [ ] Episodic memory system stores and retrieves cross-session information
- [ ] User prompts appear for memory updates in specified trigger conditions
- [ ] Memory structure supports easy updates and compaction
- [ ] Configuration options for memory limits and thresholds
- [ ] Memory approaching limits triggers user interaction for management
- [ ] **Memory is seamlessly integrated with agent workflow without requiring explicit management**
- [ ] Relevant memory automatically injected into agent context based on conversation relevance
- [ ] Documentation covers memory management configuration and usage
- [ ] Tests validate memory compaction and episodic storage functionality

## Implementation Considerations

### Configuration Schema
```yaml
memory:
  session:
    compaction_threshold: 10000  # tokens
    compaction_strategy: "summarize"  # summarize, truncate, selective
  episodic:
    token_limit: 100000
    categories:
      - user_preferences
      - rules
      - lessons_learned  
      - user_decisions
    compaction_warning_threshold: 90000  # 90% of limit
  integration:
    auto_inject: true  # Automatically inject relevant memory
    relevance_threshold: 0.7  # Similarity threshold for memory retrieval
```

### Memory Categories
1. **User Preferences**: Settings, choices, and behavioral preferences
2. **Rules**: Established guidelines and constraints
3. **Lessons Learned**: Mistakes made and corrections applied
4. **User Decisions**: Important decisions and their context

### User Interaction Design
- **Detection prompts**: "I noticed [trigger condition]. Should I update memory with [specific information]?"
- **Memory management**: "Episodic memory is approaching limit. Would you like to review and compact it?"
- **Memory review**: Interface to view, edit, and organize episodic memory entries

## Related Components
- **Memory system**: Core memory management infrastructure
- **Agent interface**: User interaction and prompting mechanisms
- **Configuration**: Memory settings and thresholds
- **Persistence**: Cross-session memory storage and retrieval

## Priority Justification
This feature addresses critical limitations in current memory management that impact both performance (context overflow) and user experience (lack of learning persistence). The automatic session management prevents technical failures while episodic memory enables true agent learning and personalization.
