# Code Refactoring Workflow

**A comprehensive workflow for systematic code refactoring following SDLC best practices.**

## Overview

This workflow provides a structured approach to code refactoring that incorporates Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) best practices, ensuring systematic analysis, design, implementation, and validation of architectural changes.

## Phase 1: Analysis & Requirements (ultrathink)

### 1.1 Current State Analysis
```bash
# Analyze existing codebase structure
- Document current class hierarchy and dependencies
- Identify design patterns in use (inheritance, composition, etc.)
- Map control flow and data flow
- Identify pain points and technical debt
- Analyze test coverage and existing test patterns
```

**Deliverables:**
- Architecture diagram of current state
- Dependency analysis report  
- Pain points documentation
- Test coverage analysis

### 1.2 Problem Identification
```bash
# Systematic issue identification
- Performance bottlenecks
- Tight coupling issues
- Violation of SOLID principles
- Code duplication
- Complex inheritance chains
- Missing abstractions
- Testability issues
- Maintainability concerns
```

**Deliverables:**
- Issues prioritization matrix
- Impact assessment document

### 1.3 Requirements Gathering
```bash
# Define refactoring objectives
- Functional requirements (what must be preserved)
- Non-functional requirements (performance, maintainability, testability)
- Backward compatibility requirements
- Migration path requirements
- Timeline and resource constraints
```

**Deliverables:**
- Requirements specification document
- Acceptance criteria definition

## Phase 2: Design & Planning

### 2.1 Architecture Design
```bash
# Design new architecture following SOLID principles
- Define clear separation of concerns
- Design dependency injection patterns
- Plan abstraction layers (interfaces, base classes)
- Design control flow and data flow
- Consider design patterns (Factory, Builder, Strategy, etc.)
- Plan for extensibility and testability
```

**Tools:**
- UML class diagrams
- Sequence diagrams
- Component diagrams

### 2.2 Interface Design
```bash
# Define clean interfaces and contracts
- Abstract base classes (ABCs) with clear responsibilities
- Method signatures and return types
- Error handling strategies
- Dependency injection points
- Public API design
```

**Principles:**
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

### 2.3 Migration Strategy
```bash
# Plan the migration approach
- Backward compatibility strategy
- Deprecation timeline
- Migration path for existing code
- Breaking changes documentation
- Rollback strategy
```

**Approaches:**
- **Strangler Fig Pattern**: Gradually replace old code
- **Big Bang**: Complete replacement (high risk)
- **Parallel Run**: Run old and new systems side by side

### 2.4 Documentation Plan
```bash
# Plan documentation updates
- API documentation updates
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Migration guides
- Code examples and tutorials
- Updated README and getting started guides
```

## Phase 3: Implementation

### 3.1 Setup & Preparation
```bash
# Prepare development environment
- Create feature branch
- Set up task tracking (todo management)
- Backup current state
- Set up parallel testing environment
```

### 3.2 Incremental Implementation
```bash
# Follow systematic implementation approach
1. Create new interfaces and abstract base classes
2. Implement new concrete classes
3. Add factory functions and builders
4. Create dependency injection infrastructure
5. Update examples and usage patterns
6. Add backward compatibility layers (if needed)
```

**Best Practices:**
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) where possible
- Frequent commits with clear messages

### 3.3 Code Quality Gates
```bash
# Maintain code quality throughout implementation
- Static code analysis (linting, type checking)
- Unit test coverage maintenance
- Integration test updates
- Code review checkpoints
- Performance regression testing
```

### 3.4 Documentation as Code
```bash
# Keep documentation synchronized

```

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation

### 4.1 Test Strategy
```bash
# Comprehensive testing approach
- Unit tests for new components

- Regression tests for existing functionality
- Performance tests for critical paths
- Migration tests for upgrade scenarios
```

### 4.2 Test Categories
```bash
# Test pyramid implementation
- Unit Tests: Individual components in isolation
- Integration Tests: Component interactions
- System Tests: End-to-end functionality
- Acceptance Tests: User scenario validation
```

### 4.3 Validation Criteria
```bash
# Define success criteria
- All existing tests pass
- New functionality tests pass
- Performance benchmarks met
- Code coverage thresholds maintained
- Static analysis passes
- Security scans clean
```

## Phase 5: Cleanup & Optimization

### 5.1 Remove Deprecated Code
```bash
# Clean up legacy code systematically
1. Identify all deprecated components
2. Remove backward compatibility code (if timeline allows)
3. Clean up unused imports and dependencies
4. Remove dead code paths
5. Simplify complex conditional logic
```

### 5.2 Code Optimization
```bash
# Optimize the refactored codebase
- Performance optimization
- Memory usage optimization
- Reduce code complexity
- Eliminate code duplication
- Improve error handling
```

### 5.3 Final Validation
```bash
# Final quality assurance
- Complete test suite execution
- Performance baseline verification
- Security audit
- Documentation review
- Code review and approval
```

## Phase 6: Deployment & Monitoring

### 6.1 Deployment Strategy
```bash
# Plan production deployment

## Refactoring Patterns

### Dependency Injection Pattern
```python
# OLD: Internal creation
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, enable_memory=True):
        if enable_memory:
            self.memory = MemorySession()  # Tight coupling

# NEW: External injection
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, memory_session: Optional[MemorySession] = None):
        self.memory_session = memory_session  # Loose coupling
```

### Multiple Inheritance Pattern
```python
# Combine concerns through composition of interfaces
class RootAgent(App, AgentInterface):
    """Combines application logic + agent interface"""
    def __init__(self, memory_session=None, **kwargs):
        App.__init__(self, **kwargs)
        AgentInterface.__init__(self, memory_session=memory_session, **kwargs)
```

### Factory Pattern
```python
# Clean object creation
def create_memory_session(name=None, enable_memory=True):
    """Factory for dependency injection"""
    if enable_memory:
        return MemorySession(name=name)
    return None
```
