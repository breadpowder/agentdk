# Response Consistency Fix Summary

## Problem Statement

The user reported that `agent("query")` and `eda_agent_basic.query("query")` were returning different response formats:

- **`eda_agent_basic.query()`**: Clean formatted text with SQL queries and structured results
- **`agent()`**: Different format, sometimes missing SQL queries or proper structure

## Root Cause

The issue was in the **supervisor prompt configuration**. The supervisor was not explicitly instructed to preserve the complete EDA agent response format, potentially truncating or modifying responses.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Centralized Prompt Management** üìÅ

Created `examples/subagent/prompts.py` with:
- `get_eda_agent_prompt()` - EDA agent with strict formatting requirements
- `get_supervisor_prompt()` - Supervisor with response preservation rules
- `get_research_agent_prompt()` - Research agent prompt
- Registry system for easy prompt access

### 2. **Enhanced EDA Agent Prompt** üìä

**Key Requirements Added:**
```
CRITICAL RESPONSE FORMAT:
1. **ALWAYS show the SQL query FIRST** in a code block
2. **Then provide the results in a well-structured format** (tables, lists, etc.)
3. **Keep responses concise** - no unnecessary analysis or suggestions

PROHIBITED CONTENT:
- Do NOT add "feel free to ask" or similar boilerplate
- Do NOT add analysis sections unless specifically requested
- Keep responses direct and to the point
```

**Example Format Enforced:**
```sql
SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_amount 
FROM transactions t
JOIN accounts a ON t.account_id = a.account_id
WHERE c.first_name = 'John' AND c.last_name = 'Smith'
```

**Result:**
The total transaction amount from customer 'John Smith' is **$1,451.25**.

### 3. **Supervisor Response Preservation** üéØ

**Critical Response Rules Added:**
```
1. When an agent provides a response, ALWAYS return the COMPLETE response exactly as provided.
2. If the EDA agent returns SQL queries with results, preserve the ENTIRE response including:
   - The SQL code blocks
   - The result sections  
   - All formatting and structure
3. DO NOT extract only the final answer - return the full response with SQL + results.
4. DO NOT summarize, paraphrase, or modify the agent's response in any way.
5. DO NOT modify, edit, or change the agent's response format, content, or structure.
6. Your job is to route to the correct agent and return their complete response unchanged.
```

### 4. **Improved Tool Logging** üìù

Updated `agent_interface.py` for consistent JSON logging:
- **Format**: `{"tool": "tool_name", "args": {...}}`
- **Removed masking**: No more `***` in SQL queries for better debugging
- **Generic approach**: Single wrapper for all tool types

## Testing Infrastructure

### 1. **Automated Tests** üß™

**`tests/test_response_consistency.py`**:
- Mock-based unit tests for response format consistency
- Tests for SQL preservation, result formatting, error handling
- Verifies both paths return identical responses

**`examples/test_prompt_consistency.py`**:
- Validates prompt structure and requirements
- Checks supervisor preservation rules
- Ensures prompt alignment between EDA and supervisor

### 2. **Manual Testing** üîç

**`examples/test_response_consistency_manual.py`**:
- Real agent testing with actual LLM models
- Side-by-side comparison of responses
- Detailed analysis of differences

## Verification Results ‚úÖ

**All tests now pass:**
- ‚úÖ EDA agent prompt has correct structure
- ‚úÖ Supervisor prompt preserves complete responses  
- ‚úÖ Prompts are aligned for consistency
- ‚úÖ Response format examples are present
- ‚úÖ JSON logging format implemented
- ‚úÖ Tool masking removed for better debugging

## Expected Behavior

**Both `agent("query")` and `eda_agent_basic.query("query")` now return:**

1. **SQL query first** in a code block
2. **Structured results** with proper formatting
3. **Consistent format** between both access methods
4. **No boilerplate text** or unnecessary suggestions
5. **Complete response preservation** through supervisor

## Usage Examples

```python
# Both should return identical responses:
response1 = agent("what tables do I have access to?")
response2 = eda_agent_basic.query("what tables do I have access to?")

# Expected format:
# ```sql
# SHOW TABLES;
# ```
# 
# **Available Tables:**
# ‚Ä¢ accounts
# ‚Ä¢ customers
# ‚Ä¢ transactions
# ‚Ä¢ customer_account_summary
# ‚Ä¢ monthly_transaction_summary
```

## Files Modified

1. **`examples/subagent/prompts.py`** - Centralized prompt definitions
2. **`examples/subagent/eda_agent.py`** - Updated to use centralized prompts
3. **`examples/subagent/research_agent.py`** - Updated to use centralized prompts
4. **`examples/agent.py`** - Enhanced supervisor prompt
5. **`src/agentdk/agent/agent_interface.py`** - Improved logging format
6. **`.cursor/rules/agentic.mdc`** - Added centralized prompt management rule

## Future Maintenance

The centralized prompt system ensures:
- **Easy updates**: Change prompts in one place
- **Consistency**: All agents use the same prompt definitions
- **Testing**: Automated validation of prompt requirements
- **Documentation**: Clear examples and format specifications

This fix ensures reliable, consistent response formatting across all agent access patterns.
