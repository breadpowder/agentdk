# PLAN MODE VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

## ✓ PLAN VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: ALL COMPLETE ✅

### Requirements Documentation
- [x] ✅ Requirements clearly documented in tasks.md
- [x] ✅ Project brief comprehensive and detailed
- [x] ✅ All 6 implementation phases defined
- [x] ✅ Dependencies and constraints identified

### Technology Stack Validation  
- [x] ✅ Technology stack validated through proof of concept
- [x] ✅ Python 3.12+ environment confirmed
- [x] ✅ Dependencies installed and tested
- [x] ✅ Build process successful
- [x] ✅ Async patterns verified working

### Component Analysis
- [x] ✅ Affected components identified:
  - src/agentdk/core/ (mcp_load.py, logging)
  - src/agentdk/agent/ (agent_interface.py enhancement)
  - examples/subagent/ (eda_agent.py refactoring)
  - pyproject.toml (package configuration)
  - Testing infrastructure (Docker MySQL)

### Implementation Planning
- [x] ✅ Implementation steps clearly defined in 6 phases

- [x] ✅ Timeline estimates provided (4-week plan)
- [x] ✅ Task dependencies documented

### Challenges & Mitigations  
- [x] ✅ Dependencies and challenges documented:
  - Async compatibility → nest_asyncio solution
  - MCP configuration → multiple location support
  - Logging centralization → centralized design
  - Testing complexity → Docker solution
  - Package structure → backward compatibility plan

### Creative Phases Identification
- [x] ✅ Creative phases identified for Level 3 task:
  - Architecture Design (Agent interface patterns)
  - MCP Integration (Server management architecture)
  - Testing Strategy (Docker and data architecture)  
  - API Design (Public interface patterns)

### Documentation Updates
- [x] ✅ tasks.md updated with comprehensive plan

## FINAL VERIFICATION: ✅ ALL REQUIREMENTS MET

### Planning Quality Assessment
- **Comprehensiveness**: ✅ EXCELLENT - All aspects covered
- **Technical Depth**: ✅ EXCELLENT - Technology validated
- **Implementation Clarity**: ✅ EXCELLENT - Clear phases and steps
- **Risk Management**: ✅ EXCELLENT - Challenges identified with solutions
- **Creative Phase Planning**: ✅ EXCELLENT - Design decisions identified

## PLAN MODE STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE

**Ready for next mode transition**

## RECOMMENDED NEXT MODE: CREATIVE MODE

The following components require design decisions and creative problem-solving:

1. **Agent Interface Architecture** - How to structure SubAgentInterface inheritance
2. **MCP Integration Patterns** - Configuration loading and server management
3. **Testing Infrastructure Design** - Docker setup and data architecture
4. **Public API Design** - Agent creation and usage patterns

Type 'CREATIVE' to begin the design decision phase.
