# COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT RESULTS

## Task Analysis: AgentDK Refactoring Project

### Complexity Indicators:
- **Scope Impact**: Multiple components (core/, agent/, examples/)
- **Risk Level**: Medium-High (architectural changes, async patterns)
- **Implementation Effort**: Significant (new interfaces, MCP integration, testing setup)
- **Keywords**: "refactoring", "architecture", "integration", "testing infrastructure"

### Determination: LEVEL 3 - Intermediate Feature
- Requires comprehensive planning
- Multiple interconnected components
- New architectural patterns
- Integration with external systems (MCP servers)
- Testing infrastructure setup

### Required Process Flow:
VAN → PLAN → CREATIVE → VAN QA → BUILD

CRITICAL: This task CANNOT proceed in VAN mode alone
FORCE MODE SWITCH to PLAN mode is REQUIRED
