# Technology Validation Report - COMPLETED

## Technology Stack Selection

### Core Technologies
- **Language**: Python 3.12+ ✅
- **Framework**: LangGraph + MCP (Model Context Protocol) ✅
- **Build Tool**: Hatchling ✅
- **Package Manager**: uv ✅
- **Async Runtime**: asyncio + nest_asyncio (IPython compatibility) ✅

### Key Dependencies
- `langchain-core>=0.3.63` ✅
- `langchain-mcp-adapters>=0.1.7` ✅
- `langgraph>=0.4.8` ✅
- `nest-asyncio>=1.6.0` ✅
- `mcp[cli]>=1.8.1` ✅

### Validation Results
- [x] ✅ Python environment verified (3.12.3)
- [x] ✅ Dependencies installed successfully via uv sync
- [x] ✅ Build system configured (hatchling)
- [x] ✅ Package structure exists (src/agentdk/)
- [x] ✅ Hello world proof of concept successful
- [x] ✅ Async patterns working correctly
- [x] ✅ Agent interface imports successfully
- [x] ✅ Build process completes successfully

## Technology Validation Checklist
- [x] ✅ Technology stack clearly defined
- [x] ✅ Project structure documented
- [x] ✅ Required dependencies identified and installed
- [x] ✅ Minimal proof of concept created and tested
- [x] ✅ Hello world build/run successful
- [x] ✅ Configuration files validated (pyproject.toml)
- [x] ✅ Test build completes successfully

## Proof of Concept Results
```
🚀 AgentDK Hello World Proof of Concept
==================================================
✅ Successfully imported AgentDK components
✅ nest_asyncio applied for IPython compatibility
🧪 Testing async agent patterns...
🔄 Initializing HelloWorldAgent...
✅ HelloWorldAgent initialized successfully
📝 Agent response: Hello! You said: 'Hello AgentDK!'
🔄 State processing result: {'response': "Hello! You said: 'test state'"}

🎉 All tests passed!
✅ Technology stack validation successful
```

## Build Validation Results
- Package built successfully: `agentic_media_gen-0.1.0.tar.gz`
- Wheel created: `agentic_media_gen-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`
- Build system functioning correctly

## Issues Identified
1. **Package Name Mismatch**: pyproject.toml has "agentic-media-gen" but should be "agentdk"
2. **Package Path**: Build creates "agentic_media_gen" but should create "agentdk"

## Status: ✅ TECHNOLOGY VALIDATION COMPLETE
All core technology components validated successfully. Ready to proceed with implementation.

## Next Steps
1. Fix package naming in pyproject.toml
2. Proceed to CREATIVE mode for architecture decisions
3. Begin implementation phases
