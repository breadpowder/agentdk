# Active Context - AgentDK Refactoring

## Current Focus
PLAN MODE COMPLETED ✅ - Comprehensive refactoring plan created with validated technology stack.

## Key Design Decisions Identified for CREATIVE Mode
1. **Architecture Pattern**: SubAgentInterface inheritance and async initialization
2. **MCP Integration**: Configuration loading, server management, and tool wrapping
3. **Async Compatibility**: IPython/Jupyter integration patterns
4. **Testing Strategy**: Docker MySQL setup and test data architecture
5. **Package Structure**: Proper pip distribution configuration

## Technology Validation Status: ✅ COMPLETE
- All core dependencies validated
- Async patterns confirmed working
- Build process successful
- Agent interface functioning correctly

## Implementation Plan Summary
```
Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (HIGH) 
├── MCP configuration loading ✅ Planned
├── Centralized logging ✅ Planned  
└── Package structure fixes ✅ Planned

Phase 2: Agent Interface (HIGH)
├── Enhanced SubAgentInterface ✅ Planned
├── Async initialization ✅ Planned
└── MCP integration ✅ Planned

Phase 3-6: Additional phases fully planned ✅
```

## Creative Phases Required
- [x] **Architecture Design**: Agent interface patterns (READY)
- [x] **MCP Integration**: Server management patterns (READY)
- [ ] **Testing Strategy**: Docker and data structure (PENDING)
- [ ] **API Design**: Public interface patterns (PENDING)

## Next Action Required
**TRANSITION TO CREATIVE MODE** - Architecture decisions need design exploration and documentation.

## Immediate Priorities for CREATIVE Mode
1. Design SubAgentInterface architecture pattern
2. Define MCP integration and configuration strategy  
3. Plan testing infrastructure architecture
4. Design public API patterns for agent creation
