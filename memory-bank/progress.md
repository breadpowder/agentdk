# Progress Tracking - AgentDK Refactoring

## Completed ✅
- [x] Memory Bank structure created
- [x] Project brief documented  
- [x] Task complexity assessed as Level 3
- [x] Initial task breakdown completed
- [x] Technology stack validation COMPLETED
- [x] Proof of concept successful
- [x] Build process verified
- [x] Comprehensive implementation plan created
- [x] PLAN mode completed successfully
- [x] **CREATIVE MODE COMPLETED** ✅

## Creative Phase Results ✅ ALL COMPLETE
- [x] **Agent Interface Architecture** - Enhanced inheritance pattern
- [x] **MCP Integration Strategy** - Agent-level config loading
- [x] **Testing Infrastructure Design** - Docker Compose + pytest
- [x] **Package Structure & API Design** - Layered structure with public API

## Technology Updates ✅
- [x] Python version requirement updated to 3.11+
- [x] All dependencies confirmed compatible with Python 3.11+
- [x] Package naming strategy defined (agentdk)
- [x] Public API patterns designed

## Design Decisions Made ✅
1. **Agent Architecture**: Enhanced SubAgentInterface with async initialization
2. **MCP Integration**: Shared utilities with agent-level config loading
3. **Testing Strategy**: Docker MySQL with realistic sample data
4. **Package Structure**: Layered organization with clean public API
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Factory pattern supporting existing usage

## Creative Artifacts Created ✅
- `memory-bank/creative/creative-agent-interface-architecture.md`
- `memory-bank/creative/creative-mcp-integration-strategy.md`
- `memory-bank/creative/creative-testing-infrastructure.md`
- `memory-bank/creative/creative-package-structure-api.md`

## Ready for Next Phase ✅
**VAN QA MODE** - Technical validation of creative decisions before implementation

All design decisions have been made and documented. The project is ready for:
1. Technical validation of the creative decisions
2. Verification of implementation feasibility
3. Final checks before beginning BUILD phase

## Implementation Readiness: ✅ FULLY READY
- Architecture patterns defined and documented
- Technology stack validated (Python 3.11+)
- Package structure designed
- Testing infrastructure planned
- All creative phases complete

## Next Action Required
Type **'VAN QA'** to begin technical validation of the creative design decisions.
